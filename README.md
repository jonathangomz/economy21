# Economy21

The Economy21 API gets his name after the spreadsheet that I use for my
personal finances. I started working on that spreadsheet since 21, and I
named like that to not confuse myself with other financial spreadsheets
from other years. But this file evolve into the one that I'm still using
even 4 years later. But now I need more and from this necessity this project
was born.
